              For me, I find Laravel Documentation <a href="https://laravel.com/docs" target="_blank" className="text-xl text-blue-900">(<u>https://laravel.com/docs</u>)</a> incredibly helpful and well-rounded as it covers everything from core features to integrations with frontend frameworks like React with Inertia , Vue with Inertia, and Livewire, which I use frequently. Also clear examples and setup guides are provided for easy adaptation of Laravel to various environments. What stands out to me is Laravel’s diverse community and ecosystem with active community forums and a lot of tutorials where support and resources are always available for most project I’m working on. Laravel is one of the frameworks that is compact, making it one of my go-to framework.
